Using the practice database provided in this module, create queries to answer to the following questions:

1.List the customers who made purchases between 2011 and 2012.

SELECT FirstName, LastName
FROM Customer
WHERE CustomerId IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT CustomerId
    FROM Invoice
    WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2011-01-01' AND '2012-12-31'
);

2. List the customers, sales reps and total transaction amounts for each customer in the same period of time.

SELECT
    c.FirstName AS CustomerFirstName,
    c.LastName AS CustomerLastName,
    e.FirstName AS SalesRepFirstName,
    e.LastName AS SalesRepLastName,
    SUM(i.Total) AS TotalTransactionAmount
FROM Customer AS c
INNER JOIN Employee AS e ON c.SupportRepId = e.EmployeeId
INNER JOIN Invoice AS i ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId
WHERE i.InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2011-01-01' AND '2012-12-31'
GROUP BY c.CustomerId
ORDER BY CustomerFirstName, CustomerLastName;

3. How many transactions are above the average transaction amount during said time?

SELECT COUNT(*) AS AboveAverageTransactions
FROM Invoice
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2011-01-01' AND '2012-12-31'
  AND Total > (
    SELECT AVG(Total)
    FROM Invoice
    WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2011-01-01' AND '2012-12-31'
  );

4. What was the average transaction amount for each year?

SELECT
    SUBSTR(InvoiceDate, 1, 4) AS Year,
    AVG(Total) AS AverageTransactionAmount
FROM Invoice
GROUP BY SUBSTR(InvoiceDate, 1, 4)
ORDER BY Year;
