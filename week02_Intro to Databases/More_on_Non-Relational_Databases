1. Graph Databases

Main Use:
Graph databases are designed to efficiently store and manage data that has complex relationships and dependencies.
They excel in applications where you need to model and query highly connected data, such as social networks,
recommendation engines, and fraud detection systems.

How They Work:
In a graph database, data is represented as nodes (entities) and edges (relationships) between these nodes.
Each node and edge can have properties associated with them. Graph databases use a graph data structure to traverse
and query relationships efficiently, making them ideal for applications that rely on traversing connected data.

Practical Example:
Neo4j is a prominent graph database used in various industries. For example, a social networking platform like LinkedIn uses Neo4j
to manage and analyze the relationships between users. It can help identify connections and suggest relevant professional
connections to users based on their existing network connections, skills, and interests.

2. Column-family Stores (Wide-Column Stores)

Main Use:
Column-family stores, often known as wide-column stores, are designed for handling and managing large volumes of data,
especially when dealing with vast amounts of data with high write and read scalability.
They are widely used in applications that require real-time data retrieval, like analytics, time-series data, and event logging.

How They Work:
In column-family stores, data is organized into column families, which are a collection of related columns, and rows with a
unique row key. These databases efficiently handle wide, sparse data structures and are optimized for read-heavy workloads.
They provide high write throughput and are capable of scaling horizontally.

Practical Example:
Apache Cassandra is a well-known column-family store used by organizations like Netflix. It is used for managing time-series data,
such as user activity logs, video streaming statistics, and real-time analytics. Netflix uses Cassandra to store
and analyze user interactions, ensuring smooth and personalized content recommendations.
