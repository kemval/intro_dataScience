Using the Some_Records Database from Week 3, create the following queries using the new SQL commands learnt this week.

1.Create a mailing list of US based customers using string concatenation.
This must show: First Name, Last Name, Address, City, State and Postal Code (only the first 5 digits).
The bucket must be called MailingAddress.

SELECT
    FirstName || ' ' || LastName AS Full_Name,
    Address,
    City,
    State,
    SUBSTR(PostalCode, 1, 5) AS Postal_Code
FROM Customer
WHERE Country = 'USA';

2. Calculate the ages of the employees using STRFTIME.

SELECT
    EmployeeId,
    FirstName || ' ' || LastName AS Full_Name,
    STRFTIME('%Y', 'now') - STRFTIME('%Y', Birthdate) - (STRFTIME('%m-%d', 'now') < STRFTIME('%m-%d', Birthdate)) AS Age
FROM Employee;

3. Using aggregate functions calculate: Total Sales, Average Sales, Top Sale, Lowest Sale and the Amount of Sales.

SELECT
    SUM(total) AS Total_Sales,
    AVG(total) AS Average_Sales,
    MAX(total) AS Top_Sale,
    MIN (total)AS Lowest_Sale,
    COUNT(total) AS Amount_of_Sales
FROM Invoice;
